		<p><b> Abstract: </b> We propose a new objective function for superpixel segmentation. This objective function consists of two components: entropy rate of a random walk on a graph and a balancing term. The entropy rate favors formation of compact and homogeneous clusters, while the balancing function encourages clusters with similar sizes. We present a novel graph construction for images and show that this construction induces a matroid--- a combinatorial structure that generalizes the concept of linear independence in vector spaces. The segmentation is then given by the graph topology that maximizes the objective function under the matroid constraint. By exploiting submodular and monotonic properties of the objective function, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm. Furthermore, we prove an approximation bound of $\frac{1}{2}$ for the optimality of the solution. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley segmentation benchmark show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state of the art in all the standard evaluation metrics.</p>

		<p><b> Abstract:</b> We present a practical vision-based robotic bin-picking system that performs detection and 3D pose estimation of objects in an unstructured bin using a novel camera design, picks up parts from the bin, and performs error detection and pose correction while the part is in the gripper. Two main innovations enable our system to achieve real-time robust and accurate operation. First, we use a multi-flash camera that extracts robust depth edges. Second, we introduce an efficient shape-matching algorithm called fast directional chamfer matching (FDCM), which is used to reliably detect objects and estimate their poses. FDCM improves the accuracy of chamfer matching by including edge orientation. It also achieves massive improvements in matching speed using line-segment approximations of edges, a 3D distance transform, and directional integral images. We empirically show that these speedups, combined with the use of bounds in the spatial and hypothesis domains, give the algorithm sublinear computational complexity. We also apply our FDCM method to other applications in the context of deformable and articulated shape matching. In addition to significantly improving upon the accuracy of previous chamfer matching methods in all of the evaluated applications, FDCM is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the previous methods. </p>

		<b> Abstract: </b> We study the object localization problem in images given a single hand-drawn example or a gallery of shapes as the object model. Although many shape matching algorithms have been proposed for the problem over the decades, chamfer matching remains to be the preferred method when speed and robustness are considered. In this paper, we significantly improve the accuracy of chamfer matching while reducing the computational time from linear to sublinear (shown empirically). Specifically, we incorporate edge orientation information in the matching algorithm such that the resulting cost function is piecewise smooth and the cost variation is tightly bounded. Moreover, we present a sublinear time algorithm for exact computation of the directional chamfer matching score using techniques from 3D distance transforms and directional integral images. In addition, the smooth cost function allows to bound the cost distribution of large neighborhoods and skip the bad hypotheses within. Experiments show that the proposed approach improves the speed of the original chamfer matching upto an order of 45x, and it is much faster than many state of art techniques while the accuracy is comparable.
